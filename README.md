# FlicApp
A Project involving a Flic button and iOS app

This project was designed and created to help send an alert when a patient at St. Vincent hospital, Ottawa, 
needed assistance after falling down. The alert is received by nurses on their phones via this iOS app 
when the patient clicks on the Flic button.
